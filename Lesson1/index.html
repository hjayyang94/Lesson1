<body>
    <!-- This is the body. The body is where all the content in your website will go in. Only 1 body every html document. -->
    <div>
        <!--This is a div. It is a general container. Just like in real life, it is nice to 
            compartimentalize and have things in an ordered, logical fashion, stored away in each container.
            Divs can be used for many ways and formatted in ways to style or change the way your website looks.
            html has predefined divs too. For example, you already know <body>. Body is a special type of div with
                properties that allows html to know that is your main content. -->

        <h1>Hello world, welcome to lesson 2! I'm a header</h1>

        <p>And this is a p tag. We're inside different divs. Special ones in fact. </p>
        <p>Whatever you type between the two p tags will appear in text. In short, it's the text content.</p>
        <p>Now let's try making our webpage a little more colorful.</p>
        
        <p>Up above in the head tag, uncomment the line that starts with "link"</p>

       <p class = "special">This text is white</p>
       <p class = "special">And so is this text. This is because we share a class.</p>

       <p class = "special">That's the basic introduction for basic text and editing. Let's do cooler stuff!</p>

       <p class = "special">
            Try adding a video. You're going to be using something called iframe. look it up on W3schools!
       </p>
